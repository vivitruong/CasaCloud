# Welcome To CasaCloud

CasaCloud is a website clone, inspired by Airbnb. This project has been developed with the goal of replicating the essential features and functionalities of Airbnb, allowing users to filter and book vacation rentals, as well as to list their own properties for rent. It is a fullstack Postgres, Node, React, Redux, CSS application. The majority of the application logic occurs within front end's Redux store and it uses pure css for styling components.

The backend serves the frontend, responds to frontend requests, and fetches data from the Postgres database.
